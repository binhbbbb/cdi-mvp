# CDI MVP

MVP is an emphasized pattern for larger Vaadin applications.
CDI MVP provides a lightweight approach to building a foundation for your front-end layer with Vaadin and MVP.

A good example on how to use CDI MVP in a Vaadin project can be found in [https://github.com/tomivirkki/cdiutils-addressbook](https://github.com/tomivirkki/cdiutils-addressbook).

**The add-on can only be used in [Vaadin CDI](https://vaadin.com/addon/vaadin-cdi) enabled projects.**
